Network repository is not only the first interactive repository, but also the largest network repository with thousands of donations in 30+ domains (from biological to social network data). This repository was made by Ryan A. Rossi and Nesreen K. Ahmed.  
- Blog: [Graph Classification:](https://paperswithcode.com/task/graph-classification/latest) The mission of Papers With Code is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code and evaluation tables.  
- Blog: [Graph Challenge Data Sets:](https://graphchallenge.mit.edu/data-sets) Amazon is making the Graph Challenge data sets available to the community free of charge as part of the AWS Public Data Sets program. The data is being presented in several file formats, and there are a variety of ways to access it.
