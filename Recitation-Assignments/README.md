# Submission Instruction 

* Please register through the link: [Registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMK93A3ikwGmQKNKvCK1CXL2c3hgMQ2cr-DzDUU5u14/edit?usp=sharing)
* Create a repository inside your Github account with the exact name "Deep_Learning_F20_Assignments".
* Please review the [Projects](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Projects) for further instructions.
* After completing all tasks of every assignment set, add related Jupyter notebooks (and/or other files) in a folder in the repository, for instance, assignments-1.ipynb inside Assingment_Set_1 folder, for the first set.
* Solutions of the exercises, as well as mathematical notations, could be written in [LaTeX](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning#latex) (Advantage ~ 10 Points), either in Jupyter notebook or PDF. MS Office or any other software (Advantage ~ 5 Points) could also be used, otherwise, images of your handwriting should be included, which is not recommended! Please acknowledge which one is used.

# Scores

* Scores will be announced at the end of the course. 
* Each assignment set is scored from 100 points as well as extra rewards. Therefore, it can be more than 100.
* **Submission after the deadline will not be accepted!** 
* Failure to comply with the [Academic Honor Code](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning#academic-honor-code) will result in the ZERO score in each set and may have additional consequences!
* The score of the final project will be calculated from 100 points. It may also be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* The final score of assignments will be calculated based on the weighted average of them, from 100 points. Moreover, it may be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* Scores may be commented. Furthermore, students could also comment on their scores and request for re-evaluation in the form of email, which will be considered at the end of the course.
