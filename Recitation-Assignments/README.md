# Assignments 

## Assignment Set 1  

* Install Anaconda and Create an Environment.    
* Install Python Packages (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib) and Jupyter Lab in your new Environment.   
* Install Machine Leanring Libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow).
* Create a GitHub account.   
* Read the [Submission Instruction](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Recitation-Assignments#submission-instruction) and Register.
* Use Markdown to Prepare a Readme file for your Repositories. 
* Modify (at least enter your name) and Run the [Sample Notebook](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Recitation-Assignments/Assignment_Set_1_Sample.ipynb) in your Environment, then Upload it in your Assignments' Repository.

-> **Deadline: Saturday, Shahrivar 29, 23:59**

## Assignment Set 2

* Train neural network models (at least two different networks for each dataset, i.e., no. layers, no. neurons, activation, regularization, ...) in either Tensorflow or Pytorch to perform classification on the following datasets, then compare them with models in previous assignments:
  
   - [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)   
   - [Cifar-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and [Cifar-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
   - At least one other dataset (up to your choice)  
   
* Train neural network models (at least two different networks for each dataset, i.e., no. layers, no. neurons, activations, regularization ...) in either Tensorflow or Pytorch to perform regression on the following datasets, then compare them with models in previous assignments:

   - [California Housing Values](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing)
   - At least one other dataset (up to your choice)
   
* Build and implement a simple neural network in either Python or C++ (i.e., not utilizing machine learning libraries). It should be capable of having several layers and neurons as well as other hyperparameters (e.g., activations, optimizer, loss function, and regularization). Object-oriented (class/objects) programming should also be employed. Then train and compare your models with the same architecture at Pytorch and Tensorflow (and Keras) for the following data:
   
   - A High-Degree Perturbed Polynomial
   - [California Housing Values](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing)

**Please Note**: Datasets must be downloaded and injected manually (i.e., not loading them by libraries). Moreover, you can find many datasets, for instance, on Kaggle. Besides, Try to develop very good classifiers and regressors based on each model. Careless model architectures and hyperparameter selections, which result in poor performance, will not be appreciated and may be scored very low! 

-> Deadline: Saturday, Mehr 12, 23:59 <!--(Advantage ~ 10 Points) - Saturday, Mehr 19, 23:59-->

# Final Project

* The final project will be considered as the outcome of the course, which is understanding and effective implementation of deep learning to provide practical solutions to realistic tasks. Two scenarios for the project can be imagined, applications and development of deep learning. Developing algorithms and methods is a valuable target, but may be challenging. On the other side, applications are highly recommended for this project. Students should decide on a topic for the project based on their interests as well as discussion with their mentor, who is one of the teaching assistants up to their choice. Mentors could provide advice and assistance during the topic selection and main progress. The following steps are expected: 

    - Selecting a Mentor and Deciding on a Topic
    - Writing a Brief Proposal (at least two paragraphs) of the Project
    - Proposal Approval by the Mentor
    - The Main Phase of the Project
    - Writing and Submitting the Final Report (at least three pages) as well as Codes and Data
  
**Please Note**: You can find many sample projects as well as datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Moreover, take a look at final projects at Stanford's [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects.html). The project will have a notable share in the final score of the course. Creativity and innovations are highly appreciated and will be rewarded accordingly. Projects will be examined by the Professor and teaching assistants. In addition to them, contacts with mentors/assistants are possible through email communications. However, in some cases, skype sessions may be arranged. 

**Proposal/Report Format and Submission**: The writing and structure of the two documents are important and will be evaluated. They should be in the academic/publication format. Additionally, documents must be in PDF format, which is written either with LaTeX (Advantage ~ 5 Points) or MS Office, preferably in English. You can also use available templates. You should enter documents as well as codes and data into a repository named exactly "Applied_Machine_Learning_S20_Final_Project" (you can rename it once the course ended!). Please enter the title of your project as well as the link to its repository in the following link: [Registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4WDjIZMKNghwnWzMhJKfUPSfHzUeyb4eholMpyMILY/edit?usp=sharing)  

**Seminar Presentation**: Monday, Tir 6, 14:15 withing the [Skype Group](https://join.skype.com/kJ6WepEDrsnt) (It is recommended to prepare at least 10 slides for the presentation!) 

     Deep Learning Projects' Seminar:
     
     - Will be announced!

# Submission Instruction 

* Please register through the link: [Registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMK93A3ikwGmQKNKvCK1CXL2c3hgMQ2cr-DzDUU5u14/edit?usp=sharing)
* Create a repository inside your Github account with the exact name "Deep_Learning_F20_Assignments".
* After completing all tasks of every assignment set, add related Jupyter notebooks (and/or other files) in a folder in the repository, for instance, assignments-1.ipynb inside Assingment_Set_1 folder, for the first set.
* Projects should be located at the another repository named "Deep_Learning_F20_Projects".
* Please review the [Projects](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Projects) for further instructions.
* Solutions of the exercises, as well as mathematical notations, could be written in [LaTeX](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning#latex) (which is recommended), either in Jupyter notebook or PDF. MS Office or any other software could also be used, otherwise, images of your handwriting should be included, which is not recommended! Please acknowledge which one is used.

# Scores

* Scores will be announced at the end of the course. 
* Each assignment set is scored from 100 points as well as extra rewards. Therefore, it can be more than 100.
* **Submission after the deadline will not be accepted!** 
* Failure to comply with the [Academic Honor Code](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning#academic-honor-code) will result in the ZERO score in each set and may have additional consequences!
* The score of the final project will be calculated from 100 points. It may also be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* The final score of assignments will be calculated based on the weighted average of them, from 100 points. Moreover, it may be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* Scores may be commented. Furthermore, students could also comment on their scores and request for re-evaluation in the form of email, which will be considered at the end of the course.
